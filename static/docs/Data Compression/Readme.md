# Introduction

In information theory, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless.

- Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy.

  - No information is lost in lossless compression.
  - PNG images use lossless compression.

- Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.

  - JPEG images can and often do use lossy compression.

A device that performs data compression is referred to as an **encoder**, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a **decoder**.

Compressed files usually end with .zip, .sit and .tar. These are called extensions, and they indicate different compression formats--different types of software used to compress files.

- For PCs, .zip is most common, .sit is used often with Macs and .tar used with Linux. When you see a file with one of these extensions, it may be either a single large file or a group of files bundled together.
- Files ending in .sea or .exe are called **self-extracting files**. These are compressed files that do not require any special software to decompress.
